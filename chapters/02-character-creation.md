# 2. Character Creation
Instead of using the character generation rules found in the Mothership: Player's Survival Guide, use the following procedure.

## 2.1. Roll 6D10 for each of your Stats and Saves.
Roll 6D10 for each of your Stats (Strength, Speed, Intellect, and Combat) and Saves (Sanity, Fear, Body, Armor).

## 2.2. Pick a species and note their Stat & Save bonuses, Favored Morph, and how they deal with Panic/Stress.
There are four playable "species" in Eclipse Phase:
* **Humans** are the most populous and dominant species in the system. They made the system what it is today, both for better and worse.
    * **Favored Morph:** Any human morph (either normal or pod).
    * **Stress/Panic:** 
* **A-Syncs** are experimental humans infected with a virus that grants them psychic powers when in a Biomorph.
    * **Stat & Save Bonus:** 
    * **Favored Morph:** Any human morph (either normal or pod).
    * **Stress/Panic:** 
* **ALIs,** or Artificial Learning Algorithms, are synthetic digital minds less-powerful than the Artificial General Intelligences that caused The Fall.
    * **Stat & Save Bonus:** 
    * **Favored Morph:** 
    * **Stress/Panic:** 
* **Uplifts** are intelligent animals that have been genetically modified (“uplifted”) to be human sociable. These include Corvids, Octopi, and various Primates like Gorillas and Orangutan. Note the specific uplifted species or genus.
    * **Stat & Save Bonus:** 
    * **Favored Morph:** 
    * **Stress/Panic:**
