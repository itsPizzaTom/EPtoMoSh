# 3. Morphs
Morphs are the physical body your mind inhabits. It's best to think of it more like the suit you're wearing, as you will frequently be changing out of it.

## 3.1. Acquiring Morphs and  "Re-Sleeving"
1. **Check availability.** When you want a specific morph, roll d% against the morphâ€™s Availability. If you succeed, the morph is available. Otherwise, it is currently unavailable. You can roll morph availability everytime you resleeve.
2. **Purchase morph.** Each morph costs Morph Points (MP).
3. **Sleeve into the morph.** Roll a BODY check ([-] if sleeving into a morph of a different species). Failure means you have [-] on all checks for 24 hours (1 week on a critical). This takes 1 hour for biological brains, or 1 turn for synthetic brains.
4. **Deal with stress.** Resleeving is stressful. Roll SANITY ([-] if you remember your death). Failure increases panic by 1d5 (1d10 if you remember your death).
